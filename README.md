# Repair Game

## Goal
Create a 'repair game' with smaller minigames in P5 with TypeScript.

## Installation 

Open a terminal and do the following:

1. Install `nodejs` and `npm`.

On Debian-based distros: `sudo apt install nodejs npm`

2. Make sure `npx` is installed.

`npm install -g npx`

3. Install dependencies.

`npm install`

4. Run it!

Execute `./run.sh` from the terminal!
This will put typescript and browser-sync in watch mode so any changes will be instantly updated.

Or manually:

`npx tsc`
